Good morning to our respected Principal, esteemed teachers, invited guests, and my dear friends.🇮🇳
Today, August 15, 2026, is a historic day. We are gathered here to celebrate the 80th Independence Day of our beloved motherland, India. Exactly 79 years ago, on this very day in 1947, our country broke the chains of nearly 200 years of British rule and breathed the air of freedom for the first time.
As we stand under our beautiful Tricolor today, our hearts should be filled with immense pride. Independence is not just a date on the calendar; it is a celebration of our identity, our culture, and the spirit of a billion people."
II. Honoring Our Heroes (3–4 Minutes)
"We must never forget that this freedom was not a gift. It was earned with the blood, sweat, and tears of countless brave souls.
Let us remember the 'Father of our Nation,' Mahatma Gandhi, who showed the world that truth and non-violence are more powerful than any weapon. We honor Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who gave us the slogan 'Jai Hind' and inspired us to fight with courage. We remember the young Bhagat Singh, who sacrificed his life at a tender age so that we could live in a free India.
Names like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rani Lakshmi Bai, and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar remind us that our freedom was built by people of all backgrounds standing together. It is our duty to keep their stories alive in our hearts."
III. Our Journey and Achievements (2–3 Minutes)
"In these 80 years, India has grown from a struggling nation into a global leader. We are now the world’s largest democracy and one of its fastest-growing economies. From the Green Revolution that fed our people to reaching the Moon and Mars with our space technology, our achievements are limitless.
Whether it is in sports, science, or literature, Indians are making a mark everywhere. Our strength lies in our 'Unity in Diversity'—the fact that people of so many religions, languages, and cultures live together as one family."
IV. Our Responsibility for the Future (2 Minutes)
"But freedom also comes with responsibility. As students, we are the future architects of this nation. We may not have to fight on the borders like our soldiers, but we can fight against poverty, illiteracy, and pollution.
We can serve India by being honest, studying hard, and helping those in need. Every small act, like keeping our neighborhood clean or respecting our elders, is an act of patriotism. Let us pledge to make India a 'Developed Nation' by the year 2047, the centenary of our independence."
V. Conclusion (1 Minute)
"As I conclude, let us remember the words of Pandit Nehru: 'At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom'.
Let that flame of freedom always burn bright in our hearts. Let us work together to make India the best country in the world.
Thank you. Happy Independence Day to everyone!
Jai Hind! Vande Mataram! Bharat Mata Ki Jai!"
